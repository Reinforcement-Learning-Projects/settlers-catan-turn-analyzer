# Settlers of Catan Turn Analyzer

*Dean Attali April 2020*

You **really** think that 4 came up more than the 8? Tired of everyone "wrongly" claiming you take the longest turns? Only one way to find out!

Try it out - https://deanattali.com/settlers-catan-turn-analyzer/

Created after a few days of doing an online ReactJS course, to test my understanding. And also because we always have these fights in my family.

**Disclaimer:** Do not try to take any advice from this code! I'm a complete ReactJS noob and I'm sure in a few months I'll be ashamed of what lies behind these source files. 

### How to run

In the root folder, run `npm install` once and then `npm start` whenever you want to run the app. (Instructions for myself: to deploy, run `npm run deploy`)
